### Description

This is the latest version of AIG. This is version 2.2.5. This version has a skin, but the skin is very primative (it's still being worked on). The databases also still need work, the databases are almost like a language in their own (you can open the databases in a text editor). I'm still working on this so don't judge it as a finished product. There is no error checking yet so that also still needs to be implemented. All the code that is here was created by me only.

I would like some votes, but that isn't compulsary. ENJOY!
